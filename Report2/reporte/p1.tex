A Pb–$60$ at$\%$ Sn alloy was slowly cooled from 380°C to 50°C. Calculate the volume fraction of the primary phase at $50°$C.

\subsection{}
A Pb–$25$ at$\%$ Sn alloy was slowly cooled from 380°C to 50°C. Ideally, Sn phase is expected to precipitate within Pb-phase grains, but in reality, a eutectic structure appeared. Assuming there were no experimental issues such as weighing errors, discuss the reason why this phenomenon occurred.
